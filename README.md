## 🧠 How G.H.O.S.T. Works

G.H.O.S.T. is powered by a **Make.com** automation scenario that integrates:

- **Telegram Bot** – your chat interface
- **Google Calendar API** – for accessing events
- **Gemini AI** – for contextual planning and smart replies
- **Make.com** – the no-code engine that orchestrates it all

### 🛠️ Workflow Logic

1. You message the **Telegram bot** with either:
   - `Plan my day` → for a personalized schedule
   - Any query → for general AI support
2. Ghost checks your Google Calendar (if applicable)
3. Sends details to **Gemini AI**
4. Gemini generates a structured plan or intelligent reply
5. The Telegram bot sends it back to you instantly
